# RandomizeMAC
A very simple tool used to randomize your MAC address, working on mac only.

## Only works with 'en0' network interface.
If you want to use a different interface, you can edit the code and build it on your own system.
I don't exactly know how to switch interfaces reliably at the moment, but I plan to add it in one day.

## Please reach out if you have any issues
I have contact information on my GitHub profile or you can create an issue on the GitHub page.

## This application will ask for your password
It is not saved or stored, you can check how it is used in the source code.
